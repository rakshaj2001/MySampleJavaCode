Method overloading:
 	It refers to virtual polymorphism.
 	It is defined as a scenario where the programmer is 
 under the illusion that 1 method is performing multiple 
 tasks. But in reality there are multiple methods to 
 to perform the task independently.
 In Method overloading multiple methods :
 		-> can have same name 
 		-> can have same number of parameters
 		-> cannot have the same order of parameters
 	
 	
As seen in the above code, the value for no_of_legs is common for all the objects of the dog.
Creating memory for the same repeatedly is going lead to wastage of memory.
Hence we declare it as static which makes the variable memory to be created only once and 
change can also be done for this variable.

Static Segment:
	In programming community there is a very wrong presumption about the term static that any
variable declared as static will not be changed once assigned but in reality static doesn't mean 
constant.
static refers to the memory for the variable being created only once during program execution.

static is the keyword used to represent the static members

Static segment will contain:
-> static variable
-> static block
-> static methods

when the compilation starts the "Class Loader" will get called and it scans the entire code for
the static members
If any static members are available within the code then it will load them on to the static seg.
